# Plex-Meta Manager scripts

Misc scripts and tools. Undocumented scripts probably do what I need them to but aren't finished yet.

## Setup

1. clone repo
1. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt` [I'd suggest doing this in a virtual environment]
   Note: the `auth` scripts don't need this step if you run them in the same environment as Plex-Meta Manager itself.
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
1. Edit .env to suit

All these scripts use the same `.env` and requirements.

### `.env` contents

## Scripts:
1. [extract_collections.py](#extract_collectionspy) - extract collections from a library
1. [pmm_trakt_auth.py](#pmm_trakt_authpy) - generate trakt auth block for PMM config.yml
1. [pmm_mal_auth.py](#pmm_mal_authpy) - generate mal auth block for PMM config.yml

### OBSOLETE
1. [top-n-actor-coll.py](#top-n-actor-collpy) - generate collections for the top *n* actors in a library

## extract_collections.py

You're getting started with Plex-Meta-Manager and you want to export your existing collections

Here is a quick and dirty [emphasis on "quick" and "dirty"] way to do that.

### Usage
1. setup as above
2. Run with `python extract_collections.py`

The script will grab some details from each collection and write a metadata file that you could use with PMM.  It also grabs artwork and background.

This is extremely naive; it doesn't recreate filters, just grabs a list of everything in each collection.

For example, you'll end up with something like this for each collection:

```yaml
collections:
  ABC:
    sort_title: +++_ABC
    url_poster: ./config/TV Shows - 4K-artwork/ABC.png
    summary: A collection of ABC content
    collection_order: release
    plex_search:
      any:
        title:
          - Twin Peaks
          - Strange World
          - Designated Survivor
          - The Good Doctor
```

But it can act as a starting point or recovery backup.

## pmm_trakt_auth.py

Perhaps you're running PMM in a docker or something where getting it into interactive mode to authentication trakt is a hassle.

This little script will generate the trakt section for your PMM config file.  Most of this code is pulled from PMM's own trakt authentication; it's just been simplified to do the one thing.

You can run this on a completely separate machine to where PMM is running.

### Usage
1. Run with `python pmm_trakt_auth.py`


You'll be asked for your trakt Client ID and Client Secret then taken to a trakt web page.

Copy the PIN and paste it at the prompt.

Some yaml will be printed, ready to copy-paste into your PMM config.yml.

```
Let's authenticate against Trakt!


Trakt Client ID: JOHNNYJOEYDEEDEE
Trakt Client Secret: PETEROGERJOHNKEITH
Taking you to: https://trakt.tv/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=JOHNNYJOEYDEEDEE&redirect_uri=urn%3Aietf%3Awg%3Aoauth%3A2.0%3Aoob

If you get an OAuth error your Client ID or Client Secret is invalid

If a browser window doesn't open go to that URL manually.


Enter the Trakt pin from that web page: 9CE4045E
Copy the following into your PMM config.yml:
############################################
trakt:
  client_id: JOHNNYJOEYDEEDEE
  client_secret: PETEROGERJOHNKEITH
  authorization:
    access_token: OZZYTONYGEEZERBILL
    token_type: Bearer
    expires_in: 7889237
    refresh_token: JOHNPAULGEORGERINGO
    scope: public
    created_at: 1644589166
############################################
```

## pmm_mal_auth.py

This little script will generate the `mal` section for your PMM config file.  Most of this code is pulled from PMM's own MAL authentication; it's just been simplified to do the one thing.

You can run this on a completely separate machine to where PMM is running.

### Usage
1. `python3 -m pip install pyopenssl`
1. `python3 -m pip install requests secrets`
1. Run it with `python3 pmm_mal_auth.py`.

You'll be asked for your MyAnimeList Client ID and Client Secret then taken to a MyAnimeList web page.

Log in and click "Allow"; you'll be redirected to a localhost page that won't load.

Copy that localhost URL and paste it at the prompt.

Some yaml will be printed, ready to copy-paste into your PMM config.yml.

```
Let's authenticate against MyAnimeList!


MyAnimeList Client ID: JOHNNYJOEYDEEDEE
MyAnimeList Client Secret: PETEROGERJOHNKEITH
We're going to open https://myanimelist.net/v1/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=JOHNNYJOEYDEEDEE&code_challenge=STINGANDYSTEWART


Log in and click the Allow option.

You will be redirected to a localhost url that probably won't load.

That's fine.  Copy that localhost URL and paste it below.

Hit enter when ready:
URL: http://localhost/?code=TuomasEmppuTroyFloorKaiJukka


Copy the following into your PMM config.yml:
############################################
mal:
  client_id: JOHNNYJOEYDEEDEE
  client_secret: PETEROGERJOHNKEITH
  authorization:
    access_token: OZZYTONYGEEZERBILL
    token_type: Bearer
    expires_in: 2415600
    refresh_token: JOHNPAULGEORGERINGO

## OBSOLETE SCRIPTS

## top-n-actor-coll.py

This has been obsoleted by "Dynamic Collections" in PMM; it's left here for historical reference.

You should use Dynamic Collections instead.

Connects to a plex library, grabs all the movies.

For each movie, gets the cast from TMDB; keeps track across all movies how many times it sees each actor.  You can specify a TV library, but I haven't tested that a lot.  My one attempt showed a list of 10 actors who had each been in 1 series, which doesn't seem right.

At the end, builds a basic Plex-Meta-Manager metadata file for the top N actors.

Script-specific variables in .env:
```
CAST_DEPTH=20                   ### HOW DEEP TO GO INTO EACH MOVIE CAST
TOP_COUNT=10                    ### PUT THIS MANY INTO THE FILE AT THE END
```

`CAST_DEPTH` is meant to prevent some journeyman character actor from showing up in the top ten; I'm thinking of someone like Clint Howard who's been in the cast of many movies, but I'm guessing when you think of the top ten actors in your library you're not thinking about Clint.  Maybe you are, though, in which case set that higher.

`TOP_COUNT` is the number of actors to dump into the metadata file at the end.

`template.tmpl` - this is the beginning of the target metadata file; change it if you like, but you're on your own there.

`collection.tmpl` - this is the collection definition inserted for each actor [`%%NAME%%%` and `%%ID%%` are placeholders that get substituted for each actor]; change it if you like, but this script only knows about those two data field substitutions.

### Usage
1. setup as above
1. Run with `python top-n-actor-coll.py`

```
connecting...
getting movies...
looping over 2819 movies...
[==--------------------------------------] 5.4% ... Annihilation
```

It will go through all your movies, and then at the end print out however many actors you specified in TOP_COUNT and produce a yml file.

```
38      2231-Samuel L. Jackson

25      64-Gary Oldman

21      19278-Bill Hader

```

In my 4K movie library, the script produces:
